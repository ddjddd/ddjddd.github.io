1. 1-bit Image / Binary Image / Monochrome Image
- Every pixel owns 1-bit on/off switch

2. 8-bit Gray-level Image
- Each pixel has a gray-scale value from 0 to 255 (8 bit / 1 byte)
- Entire image - 2 Dimensional array of pixel(Bit-plane)
- In bit view - 3 Dimensional set of Bit-plane

3. 24-bit Color Image
- Each pixel has a 3 color-scale value
- Actually, stores 32-bit(4 byte); a(alpha) value for special effects

4. 8-bit Color Image
- Each pixel stores only index of Lookup table
- Make reasonably accurate image
- Little Compression




> Resolution: # of pixels in a digital image  
> Dithering: # of dots in pixel while printing
